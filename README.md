# Reddit-Image-Downloader
This is an image downloader from reddit written in python. Input the subreddit and it will give 7 images from that subreddit. It bypasses the previews and goes straight to the i.redd.it image. I used requests instead of PRAW because PRAW is extremely slow while this works in seconds to download the images.
